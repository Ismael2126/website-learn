      I'm Ishmael, a dedicated father of two amazing daughters, Azwa and Izva,
      and a passionate tech lover with a deep interest in innovation, branding,
      and personal growth. I thrive at the intersection of creativity and
      strategy, always seeking meaningful ways to tell stories, build
      identities, and bring ideas to life. Grounded in faith and mindfulness, I
      value intention in everything I do — from work to parenting. My life is a
      balance of creativity, purpose, and growth, both professionally and
      personally. Whether I’m crafting a vision or guiding my daughters through
      life’s adventures, I believe in doing things with heart, purpose, and a
      touch of quiet strength.

      <li class="home-list">IT Technician — Link Serve, Kulhudhuffushi 2009 – 2017</li>
      <p class="home-p2">
        At Link Serve, I worked as an IT Technician where I handled everything
        from hardware troubleshooting and network setup to customer support and
        system maintenance. This role laid the foundation for my problem-solving
        mindset, attention to detail, and adaptability in fast-paced
        environments. It also helped me build strong communication skills and a
        practical understanding of how technology empowers people. Since then,
        I’ve expanded my focus into creative direction, branding, and digital
        strategy — leading initiatives that bridge tech, design, and
        storytelling.
