<h1 class="head">About me</h1>
<p >Hi, I’m Ishmael — a creative strategist, tech enthusiast, and proud father of two amazing daughters, Azwa and Izva. I'm someone who believes in intentional living, meaningful work, and the quiet strength that comes from staying true to your values.</p>
<p >My journey has been anything but linear — and I’m proud of that. It started in Kulhudhuffushi, Maldives, where I grew up surrounded by a strong sense of community, family, and the simple beauty of island life. These roots shaped who I am: grounded, practical, and deeply committed to personal growth.</p>

<h1 class="headings">A Foundation in Technology</h1>
<p class="fd-1">In 2009, I stepped into the professional world as an IT Technician at Link Serve, where I worked for 8 years. That time was foundational for me. I developed hands-on skills in troubleshooting, network management, and customer support — but more than that, I learned how to think critically, adapt quickly, and serve others with patience and clarity.  </p>
<p class="fd-2">Technology gave me a toolkit. It taught me how systems work, how people interact with tools, and how to bridge the gap between technical solutions and human needs.</p>

<h1 class="head">Shifting Gears: From Tech to Port Operations</h1>
<p class="operation-1">In 2017, I joined Kulhudhuffushi Port Limited as a Clearance Associate, stepping into the world of maritime logistics and cargo operations. This shift opened up a new realm of learning — from handling documentation and regulatory compliance to coordinating with various stakeholders to ensure smooth port activities.</p>
<p class="operation-2">This role sharpened my attention to detail and strengthened my communication and coordination skills. It taught me how systems at scale operate, and how important it is to balance efficiency with integrity, especially when dealing with real people, real timelines, and real consequences.</p>


<h1 class="headings">Beyond Work: Fatherhood & Faith</h1>
<p>While my career is a big part of who I am, it’s not the whole story. At the center of my life are my daughters, Azwa and Izva. Being a father is the most important role I hold — it grounds me, motivates me, and constantly reminds me of what truly matters. They are my source of joy, strength, and inspiration to keep becoming better, day by day.</p>
<p>I also live with intention guided by my faith. Prayer, reflection, and discipline help me stay centered — especially in a world that moves fast and changes constantly. I believe in quiet growth, consistent effort, and leading by example, even when no one’s watching.</p>

<h1>What I Believe In</h1>
<li>Authenticity over perfection</li>
<li>Consistency over intensity</li>
<li>Purpose over popularity</li>
<li>Faith over fear</li>
<p>These values drive everything I do — whether I’m solving a technical issue, managing port documentation, or raising my children.</p>
